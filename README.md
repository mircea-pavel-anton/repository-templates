# Repository Templates Monorepo

Welcome to the **Repository Templates Monorepo**! This repository contains various project templates that are ready to be used to quickly scaffold new projects. The templates are managed using [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Cruft](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/), allowing for easy project creation and continuous syncing.

## Overview

This monorepo is organized with one directory per project template. Each directory contains a template for a specific type of project, like Golang applications, Python projects, static sites, and more.

Do note that all templates are making extensive use of other shared tooling within this org. For example, they all use:

- [reusable-workflows](https://github.com/mirceanton/reusable-workflows): For a shared library of standardized github workflows
- [renovate-config](https://github.com/mirceanton/renovate-config): For a shared library of renovate configurations

### Current Templates

- **Golang Template**: Scaffolds a new Golang application with a standard directory structure.

## How to Use the Templates

These templates are designed to work with Cookiecutter, a command-line utility that allows you to scaffold projects based on custom templates.

### Prerequisites

- Install [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) and [Cruft](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/#installation):
  
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Generating a New Project

- Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mirceanton/repo-templates.git
    cd repo-templates
    ```

- Choose the template you want to use (e.g., `golang`).
- Generate a project using `cruft`:

    ```bash
    cruft create https://github.com/mircea-pavel-anton/repository-templates --directory golang
    ```

- You will be prompted to fill in variables like the project name, project description, author, etc.
- A new directory will be generated for you, with all the boilerplate in place, so you can just start coding

### Updating a Project Template

I use Cruft to manage template updates. After creating a project, you can use Cruft to pull in upstream changes to the template in the future:

```bash
cruft update
```

This will pull in any changes made to the template and apply them to your project.

For convenience, there is also a GitHub Actions Workflow that runs cruft sync hourly to make sure that any changes to the upstream template are propagated ASAP to the downstream projects.

## Contributing to the Templates

If you'd like to improve or add a new template:

- Fork this repository.
- Create a new branch with your changes.
- Submit a pull request with a detailed explanation of the improvements.

Make sure any new templates follow the same structure and include a cookiecutter.json file for user input.
